## Overview: 
The crypt function is a simple implementation of a Caesar cipher, a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This function can be used to encrypt or decrypt a given string based on the specified step count.

## Function Definition:
def crypt(text, step):
    """
    Encrypts or decrypts a given string using a Caesar cipher.

    Args:
        text (string): The string to be encrypted or decrypted.
        step (int): The number of positions each character in the string should be shifted.

    Returns:
        string: The encrypted or decrypted string.
    """
## Parameters:
-text (string): The input string that you want to encrypt or decrypt.
-step (int): The number of positions to shift each character in the string. A positive value will encrypt the string, while a negative value will decrypt it.

Returns
-string: The resulting string after applying the Caesar cipher with the specified shift.

## Usage
**Encrypting a String:**
To encrypt a string, call the crypt function with the string you want to encrypt and the desired shift count.

**Decrypting a String:**
To decrypt a string, call the crypt function with the string you want to decrypt and the negative of the shift count used for encryption.

## Notes
-The function preserves the case of the letters.

-Non-alphabetic characters (such as punctuation and spaces) remain unchanged.

-The shift wraps around the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, 'Z' becomes 'A' and 'z' becomes 'a'.

## Conclusion
The crypt function is a simple yet effective tool for encrypting and decrypting text using the Caesar cipher technique. It can handle both uppercase and lowercase letters while leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged.
